## Installation

Require the package, with Composer, in the root directory of your project.

Login to the WordPress administrator dashboard and active the plugin. Then update the credentials in your `.env` environment file with your SMTP keys.

```
MAIL_HOST=null
MAIL_PORT=587
MAIL_USERNAME=null
MAIL_PASSWORD=null
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
```

If you want to specify a custom name and email address for outgoing mail, you may add the following two variables to your environment file:

```

MAIL_FROM_NAME=null
```
